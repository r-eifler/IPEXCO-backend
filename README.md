# IPEXCO - Iterative Planning Tool with Explanations of Conflicts - BACK END

## Docker Image

Unless you want to change/update the backend service, we suggest running 
the planner in a docker container. 
We provide a pre-build docker image on DockerHub: `eifler/ipexco-backend`

If you want to build your own docker image tun

```
docker build -t ipexco-backend .
```

## Setup

**Note** Make sure that the submodule **utils** is initialized and updated!

### Dependencies

The dependencies are:

- `npm` (https://www.npmjs.com/)
- `node.js` version 22 (https://nodejs.org/en)


Before first run install npm packages with:

```
npm install
```

## Environment

The back-end requires the following environment variables to run:

- `PORT` the port the web server should be listening on (default `3000`)
- `BASE_URL` the URL the backend is reachable on. It is used to compose the 
    callback URL for the services. `http://localhost:3000` should work for a
    local setup. On MacOS there might be some changes necessary since the network
    sharing between the host and docker containers is different from Linux.
- `MONGO` the URL of the mongoDB database. In a local setup 
    `mongodb://localhost:27017/ipexco` should work.
- `JWT_KEY`: a random string that is used to generate the login tokens to authenticate 
    users
- `SERVICE_KEY`: a random string that is used to authenticate any registered 
    services, e.g. planner 
- `PDDLPARSER=utils/pddl_parser/` the past to the in the `utils` submodule contained 
    PDDL parser
- `UPLOADPATH` a path to a local folder in with the uploaded images can be stored

Optional environment variables:

- `ALLOW_REGISTRATION` set to `true` allows new users to register (default `false`)
- `ALLOW_USER_STUDY_USERS` set to `true` allows users to participate in a user study
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: the API key for the OpenAI service. It is mandatory to set this variable with you own valid key if you want to use the LLM interfaces. These keys are generated from the Open AI Platform (https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).


### Run

```
npm start
```

## Platform Usage

For instruction how to use the platform we refer to the 
[README](https://github.com/r-eifler/IPEXCO-frontend/blob/dev/README.md) of the 
front-end repository.
